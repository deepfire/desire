  "Return a list of subsequences in seq delimited by delimiter.

If :remove-empty-subseqs is NIL, empty subsequences will be included
in the result; otherwise they will be discarded.  All other keywords
work analogously to those for CL:SUBSTITUTE.  In particular, the
behaviour of :from-end is possibly different from other versions of
this function; :from-end values of NIL and T are equivalent unless
:count is supplied. The second return value is an index suitable as an
argument to CL:SUBSEQ into the sequence indicating where processing
stopped."
